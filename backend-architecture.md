# Backend Architecture for wassan-kadiri

This document outlines a recommended backend architecture for the "wassan-kadiri" e-commerce application. A robust and scalable backend is crucial for handling user data, product inventory, orders, and payments.

## 1. Architectural Choice: Monolith or Microservices

- **Recommendation:** Start with a **Monolithic Architecture**.
- **Reasoning:** For a new e-commerce platform, a monolith is simpler to develop, deploy, and manage. It reduces initial operational complexity. As the application grows in traffic and features, it can be gradually broken down into microservices. A Node.js framework like **Express.js** or **NestJS** would be an excellent choice.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Web Server & API
- **Technology:** **Node.js** with **Express.js**.
- **Language:** **TypeScript** for type safety and better code maintainability, mirroring the frontend stack.
- **Function:** Expose a **RESTful API** for the React frontend to consume. This API will handle all business logic.

### b. Database
- **Technology:** **PostgreSQL**.
- **Reasoning:** PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database. It's excellent for e-commerce due to its support for transactions (ACID compliance), which is vital for handling orders and payments reliably. Its JSONB capabilities also offer flexibility for storing less structured data.
- **Schema Design:**
    - `users`: Stores user information (id, name, email, hashed_password, role).
    - `products`: Stores product details (id, name, description, price, image_url, category, stock).
    - `orders`: Stores order information (id, user_id, total_price, status, created_at).
    - `order_items`: A join table linking orders and products (order_id, product_id, quantity, price_at_time_of_purchase).
    - `cart_items`: Stores items in a user's cart (user_id, product_id, quantity).

### c. Authentication & Authorization
- **Method:** **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
- **Flow:**
    1.  User logs in with email/password.
    2.  Server verifies credentials and generates a signed JWT containing the user's ID and role.
    3.  The token is sent to the client.
    4.  The React client stores this token (e.g., in an HttpOnly cookie) and includes it in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent API requests.
    5.  A middleware on the server validates the token on protected routes.
- **Security:** Passwords must be hashed using a strong algorithm like **bcrypt**.

### d. Image & Static Asset Storage
- **Technology:** A cloud-based object storage service like **Amazon S3**, **Google Cloud Storage**, or **Cloudinary**.
- **Reasoning:** Storing user-uploaded images (like product photos) directly on the web server is not scalable. A dedicated storage service provides durability, scalability, and can serve files efficiently via a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- **Flow:** When an admin uploads an image, the backend API generates a secure, pre-signed URL for the client to upload the file directly to the storage bucket. The resulting image URL is then saved in the `products` table in the database.

## 3. Key API Endpoints (RESTful)

- **Authentication**
    - `POST /api/auth/register`: Create a new user.
    - `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate a user and return a JWT.
    - `GET /api/auth/me`: Get the current logged-in user's details.

- **Products**
    - `GET /api/products`: Get a list of all products (with filtering/searching).
    - `GET /api/products/:id`: Get details for a single product.

- **Orders**
    - `GET /api/orders`: Get the authenticated user's order history.
    - `POST /api/orders`: Create a new order from the user's cart.

- **Admin (Protected Routes - Admin Role Required)**
    - `POST /api/admin/products`: Add a new product.
    - `PUT /api/admin/products/:id`: Update an existing product (e.g., price, stock).
    - `DELETE /api/admin/products/:id`: Remove a product.

## 4. Deployment Strategy

- **Frontend (React App):** Deploy as a static site on services like **Vercel** or **Netlify**. These platforms offer seamless integration with Git, automatic deployments, and a global CDN.
- **Backend (Node.js API):** Deploy on a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like **Heroku**, **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, or in a container using **Docker** on services like **AWS Fargate** or **Google Cloud Run**.
- **Database:** Use a managed database service like **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL** or **Heroku Postgres**. This handles backups, scaling, and maintenance.

This architecture provides a solid, scalable, and secure foundation for the wassan-kadiri e-commerce platform.
